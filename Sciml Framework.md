# SciMLSensitivity
[[SciMLSensitivity.jl]] is the **automatic differentiation and adjoints system** for the SciML ecosystem. Also known as **local sensitivity analysis**, these methods allow for calculation of fast derivatives of SciML problem types which are commonly used to analyze model sensitivities, calibrate models to data, train neural ODEs, perform automated model discovery via universal differential equations, and more.

# DiffEqFlux
It is a high level interface that pulls together all of the tools with heuristics and helper functions to make training such deep implicit layer models fast and easy.
